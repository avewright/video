    "# Fixed NumPy Compatibility Issues\n",

    "**IMPORTANT:** Before running this notebook, restart your kernel to ensure the NumPy downgrade takes effect:\n",
    "- In Jupyter: Kernel → Restart Kernel\n",
    "- In VS Code: Restart the Python interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changes Made:\n",
    "1. **Fixed NumPy compatibility**: Downgraded NumPy from 2.2.6 to 1.26.4 to be compatible with PyTorch 2.1.0\n",
    "2. **Added error handling**: Better debugging information throughout the notebook\n",
    "3. **Improved model loading**: Added progress messages and trust_remote_code parameter\n",
    "4. **Enhanced inference function**: Better error handling and device management\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps:\n",
    "Run all cells in order after restarting the kernel.\n"
